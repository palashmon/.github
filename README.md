# .github

.github is a ✨special✨ repository, that effects other repositories.

If a repository does not have one of these resources defined, the ones from this repository will be used if present:
* Issue templates
* Pull request templates
* Code of conduct
* Organization profile
* `renovate-config.json` is used as config for onboarding new repositories with Renovate
* Possibly more?

This repository main purpose therefore is to share resources to other repositories like renovate presets.
